Forms Working perfectly













----------------Bugs----------------
- Add_assignments validators on questions not working
-For some reason all the other choices are automatically being filled
-data not being inserted in Assignments_Data

	When ever I try to:
	
		new_assignment_data = (new_assignment.id, x+1, getattr(form,all_questions[x][1]).data, getattr(form,all_questions[x][2]).data, getattr(form,all_questions[x][3]).data, getattr(form,all_questions[x][4]).data, getattr(form,all_questions[x][5]).data)
        db.session.add(new_assignment_data)
        db.session.commit()
       
			-Error: sqlalchemy.orm.exc.UnmappedInstanceError: Class 'builtins.tuple' is not mapped


----------------Improvements----------------

-Add other field as disabled
-Used javascript to enable that field when other selected
on drop down menu
-DB main questions tou save krwalo
-Add solution form remove krdena chaye I think
